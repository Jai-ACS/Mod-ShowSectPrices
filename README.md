# Show Sect Prices
Extracted from MoreGridInfo mod and ported to mobile version.

This mod has been changed in the following ways after porting:
1. The feature originally had an issue where the prices would only be shown until the player selects a different sect from the trade interface (player has to close the trade interface, select the new sect, and reopens the trade interface for the prices to be displayed). This ported version has fixed that issue and will continue to show prices when different sect is selected from the trade interface.

## Main Features
Shows the prices in the interface when trading with sects.

## Known Issues
No issues known

## Planned Enhancements
No further enhancements planned
